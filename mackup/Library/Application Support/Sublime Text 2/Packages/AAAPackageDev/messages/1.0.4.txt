v1.0.4 (2015-02-08)
-------------------

(This is mostly a bug fix release and this message won't be displayed in
Package Control. A changelog has been added however.)

* The build process is now aborted early if errors from the loader and dumper
  are detected. Especially useful if you were using the "Convert ... and
  rearrange YAML def" command and were working with an invalid source file.
